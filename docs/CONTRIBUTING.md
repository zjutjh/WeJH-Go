# Contributing to wejh-go

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to wejh-go.
These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Issues

Issues are created [here](https://github.com/zjutjh/wejh-go/issues/new).


### Issue Closure

Bug reports will be closed if the issue has been inactive and the latest affected version no longer receives support. 

_If an issue has been closed and you still feel it's relevant, feel free to ping a maintainer or add a comment!_

### Languages

We accept issues in *any* language.
When an issue is posted in a language besides English, it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply.
Anyone may post the translated reply.
In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient.
Having the original text _as well as_ the translation can help mitigate translation errors.

Responses to posted issues may or may not be in the original language.
